The topic given to me was an audio recorder application which included tabs.
Steps taken by me to complete the given assignment:-
1.	I completed the tabs/fragments part of the question
2.	I integrated a void recorder in to the 1st tab
3.	I integrated the part where the selection of the file is done and the audio is played 
Steps the involve the working of the application 
•	When the app is first used on the device  it asks for permissions to use microphone and the file  on the phone
•	The default or the home page  contains 4 buttons the purpose of the 1st button is to start recording ,the purpose of the 2nd button is to stop recording, the 3rd button is used to play the recently recorded file and the 4th button is to stop 
•	The audio files re store on the device with a predetermined name which includes the system nanotime within the name 
•	The 2nd tab has a button ,after clicking the button a spinner appears  with the list of audio file in the directory  that are stored in the device
•	On selecting the file in the spinner and clicking the play button the selected audio plays and the audio can be stopped using the stop button 
The project was completed using android studio.
The application contains 2 fragments /tags the 1st tab is for recording the audio and playing the current audio file and the 2nd  tab is for playing the files that were recorded in previously
